|									|
|				Group 1 				|
|									|
|		Simulating CPU Scheduling Algorithms in C++ 		|
|READ, READ, AND READ AND FOLLOW THE INFORMATION BELOW			|
|									|
|Project Due: Monday, November 24, 2014 e 11:00 AM on Blackboard	|
|									|
|Project Defense Dates: November 24 and November 26, 2014, 		|
|			11 AM to 12:20 PM in class			|
|									|
|Project Submission: Each group's member is required to 		|
|		submit on Blackboard by the due date and time 		|
|		his/her own copy of the project implementation. 	|
|		But all the members of the group should submit 		|
|		the same implementation_ 				|
|									|
|		Submit: 1) The source code of the project 		|
|			2) The self—executable code of the project 	|
|			3) Project Evaluation form 			|
|		All these three files in a zip folder but NOT 		|
|		separately_ Name the zip folder as: 			|
|									|
|		LastFirstnamesProject2Group1 				|
|									|
|		Any member who fails to submit his/her own copy 	|
|		of the project and document on time will get 		|
|		a zero on the project					|
|									|
|Provide here the full names of the group members with 			|
|the name of the group leader on the top of the list 			|
|and replace the word author in front of my name to 			|
|Instructor. 								|

|Description: This program implements the CPU scheduling 		|
|algorithms: First Come First Served, Shortest Job First, 		|
|Priority, and Round Robin.						|
|									|
|Assumptions: This simulation considers the case of five 		|
|(5) processes. Also lower priority numbers are assigned 		|
|higher priority and all processes arrived at time 0. 			|
|Non-preemptive scheduling is used. 					|
|									|
|Possibility for Enhancement: Note that this program can		|
|be scaled to any number of processes. Also all the 			|
|input values: burst times, priority, process count, and 		|
|the quantum time could he generated randomly or could  		|
|be stored and read from a file. Adding any of theses 			|
|enhancements will result in BONUS or EXTRA POINTS. 			|
|									|
|Inputs Validity: The quantum and burst times cannot he 		|
|zero or negative. The priority cannot he negative.			|
|									|
|Testing: Use the illustration example provided in the 			|
|textbook on Page 308, Exercise 6.16 to test this program 		|
|and your group implementation of the project.				|
